    </div>
    <main class="image_class_hobby" id = "main">
      <div class="hobby_image" id="spikeball">
        <img src="images/spikeball.jpg" alt="spikeball being played"/>
      </div>

      <div class="spikeball text-block">
        <h2>Spikeball</h2>
        <p>I've been playing Spikeball for almost six years, and joined the competitive team right when I got to Michigan. I feel like in such a big university, it brings me a smaller sense of community, which I now even have a leadership position in!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="baseball">
        <img src="images/baseball.jpg" alt="baseball being played"/>
      </div>

      <div class="baseball text-block">
        <h2>Baseball</h2>
        <p>As a four year old, I did not realize how much passion I would find for baseball. However, I ended up playing all the way through high school and gaining many life leadership skills from it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="basketball">
        <img src="images/basketball.jpeg" alt="basketball being played"/>
      </div>

      <div class="basketball text-block">
        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>While I found basketball later than a lot of people I played with, I still very much enjoyed the hustle. I find that it is one of my favorite games to play with friends in college.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="sleep">
        <img src="images/sleep.jpg" alt ="someone fast asleep"/>
      </div>

      <div class="sleep text-block">
        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>As ironic as it sounds to say, sleep gives me such a boost and motivation to shape my days. Throughout 2023, I have been setting goals to ensure I get 56 hours of sleep every week!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="geoguessr">
        <img src="images/geoguessr.jpg" alt ="geoguessr home page"/>
      </div>

      <div class="geoguessr text-block">
        <h2>Geoguessr</h2>
        <p>Despite how niche of a hobby it is, I have come to really love the game of Geoguessr. I feel like I have learned so much about the world and how much I want to explore and travel when I am older.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="chess">
        <img src="images/chess.jpg" alt ="fake chess game playing"/>
      </div>

      <div class="chess text-block">
        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>During the height of Covid, I watched a lot of people play chess online, and decided I really wanted to learn. While I'm still not the best, I enjoy the mental battle that comes from the game.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="weights">
        <img src="images/weights.jpg" alt ="someone lifting weights"/>
      </div>

      <div class="weights text-block">
        <h2>Lifting Weights</h2>
        <p>Like sleep, going to the gym is something I really like planning my days around. I really feel like I can see physical and mental progress, especially on days where I lack motivation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="volleyball">
        <img src="images/volleyball.jpg" alt ="someone playing volleyball"/>
      </div>

      <div class="volleyball text-block">
        <h2>Volleyball</h2>
        <p>Vacations, retreats, intermurals, and university clubs are among the places I have learned the game of volleyball and really started to enjoy it. One day my jump serve will be perfect!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="magic">
        <img src="images/magic.jpg" alt ="magician throwing cards"/>
      </div>

      <div class="magic text-block">
        <h2>Card Magic</h2>
        <p>Also during the height of Covid, I dove into the world of magic and really liked the spontenaity of card magic. I still have my main trick mastered and love to perform it anytime!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobby_image" id="chef">
        <img src="images/chef.jpg" alt ="person cutting up vegetables"/>
      </div>

      <div class="chef text-block">
        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>While it's not my strongest skill, I enjoy cooking the meals I have mastered. I have become known among my friends for my specialty - chocolate chip pancakes.</p>
